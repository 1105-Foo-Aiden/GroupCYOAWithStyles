        Here is the setting: You and a group of friends went to a 
        cabin in the middle of the woods to escape for the weekend- on Halloween, no less! According to a local legend, there is a killer who revisits the area every year on Halloween night to claim more victims.
        Your friends are currently outside enjoying the warmth of the 
        campfire they set up, unaware of the dangers lurking in the darkness.
