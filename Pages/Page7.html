    <p>You and your friends had been partying hard for hours, the pulsating beats of music and raucous laughter creating a wild, frenetic atmosphere. The dimly lit room was filled with the energetic and carefree spirit of a memorable night out. As the hours passed, the crowd thinned as some people left the party, their drunken farewells lost in the cacophony.

It wasn't just the music that was pounding; it was the eerie feeling that something was amiss. You looked around, counting your friends, but noticed that a few familiar faces were no longer in the crowd. Two options present itself. <b>Do you look for friends? Or do you keep parting</b></p>
