        You and your friends decide to throw more logs on the fire and stay outside. 
        The hours drag on as you all slowly fall asleep on the ground. All of a sudden, you
        hear a rustling noise coming from the woods. You figure it's an animal until you hear the noise again,
        and again. The rustling begins to draw to the edge of the forest,
        but far enough away so that you can't fully make out the figure.
        You  decide to wake up all of your friends to ask if they see the same figure you do.</p>
        <p>They do...</p>
        <p><b><u>Do you go and investigate?</u></b></p>
