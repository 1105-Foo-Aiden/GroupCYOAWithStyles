            <h1> <b> Bad Ending </b> </h1>
            <p>The raucous night of celebration had gradually unraveled into a chaotic disarray. Laughter and music gave
                way to hushed conversations and whispered secrets. Everyone seemed to be "leaving," one by one, slipping
                away from the gathering like shadows retreating from the light. The dim glow of the campfire now cast
                eerie, elongated shadows across the forest floor, and the muffled sounds of the wilderness seemed to
                encroach on the isolated clearing.</p>
            <p>The alcohol had blurred your senses, leaving you swaying and vulnerable, an easy prey in this remote and
                foreboding forest. The fear that had been building in the pit of your stomach now loomed over you,
                suffocating your thoughts. You struggled to maintain your balance, unable to keep up with the sudden
                stillness of the night. </p>
            <p>Suddenly, a hand clamped over your mouth, stifling your scream. Terror surged through your veins as you
                fought to break free, but it was futile. The last thing you saw was a pair of malevolent eyes gleaming
                in the darkness, as the killer's grip tightened, and the woods swallowed your desperate pleas, ensuring
                that you, like your friends, would never be seen again., the killer gets you all (seriously, what
                where you thinking?)</p>
