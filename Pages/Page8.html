        Reluctantly, you and your friend investigate the noise. 
        As you got closer to the bush the rest of your friends walk up to get a better view. 
        As you get closer, the figure from the bushes started to make noise again, you thought you intimidated it into leaving, but how wrong you were.
        rising from the brush was a man, a man with a knife. You realize what's happening and attempt to get away. 
        The killer hunts you down one by one until you are the last one left, hiding in the cabin after watching all of your friends die in front of you.
        The killer breaks in through the back door, grabbing you by the throat and strangling you as the light leaves your eyes as the knife plunges deeper into your body.
        As your conciousness fades, the killer laughs into the night.
