    <p>
        You decide joining your friends is a good idea.
        You find them by the campfire as they beign to tell spooky stories.
        There are tales of ghosts and abaondoned cabins in the woods, werewolves and vampires.
        Stories that terrified you can all your friends, you stayed there for hours, even catching up with your friends with what you've been up to
        since the last time you all met. As the moon shines down upon you all and the night gets darker and colder,
        the conversations slow as you and your friends start to doze off.
        Eventually, the fire dies, do you stay outside or go inside?
