    <p>
        You decide staying outside with your friends is a good idea.
        You all sit around the campfire and beign to tell spooky stories.
        There are tales of ghosts and abaondoned cabins in the woods, werewolves and vampires. Tales of adevnture and death, but they all had a happy ending to some extent.
        The stories weren't as scary as to keep them up at night or anything, but they were enjoyable non the less. You all stayed there for hours, catching up with your friends with what you've been up to
        since the last time you all met, as the moon shines down upon you all and the night gets darker and colder.
        The conversations slow as you and your friends start to doze off.
        <b><u>Eventually, the fire dies, do you stay outside or go inside?</u></b>
