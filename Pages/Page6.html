    <p>You slip the glass bottle into one of the deep pockets of your coat and continue to rummage through the last remaining cupboards. You don’t find much else in terms of food and drink other than several cans of dusty Campbell’s Chicken Noodle Soup, and the snacks your friends brought on the trip. Recalling there was a cabinet near the back door that held some more non-perishables, you make your way to the back of the cabin to investigate. As you walk down the small hallway you feel a wave of cold hit you, causing you to draw your coat tighter around yourself. The cabin interior, of course was not completely immune to the effects of the weather, but it was a sturdy and well-maintained structure. It didn’t usually get this cold inside the cabin unless it was a particularly frigid winter. These thoughts raced through your mind as you reached the old cabinet, stirring within you a light sense of unease. Finding no more food, you turn to leave through the back door. No good, the padlock was still on there from last year, and the key for it was at the bottom of your bag; you’ll have to go back down the hall and leave through the front door. As you walk down the hall, you see your breath turn to a near-transparent mist in front of your eyes due to the sheer cold. You stop out of surprise, finding it really strange that it was this cold inside the cabin.</p>
