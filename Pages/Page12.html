    <p>It was rare for it to get cold enough to see your breath inside the cabin, especially in the autumn. You turned and started checking the hallway rooms, searching for any sign of damaged walls, windows, ceilings, or doors. As you entered one of the larger guest rooms, the temperature dropped several degrees around you. You quickly found the culprit- the main window of the bedroom. It sat ajar, the lock seeming as if it had been forcefully unlocked from the outside. Seeing this, you feel your hair start to raise, almost as if you can feel dangerâ€™s eyes upon you. Instinctively, your hand goes straight to your coat pocket, wrapping tightly around the neck of the hefty vodka bottle. You stand there for a few moments, straining your ears to try and hear anything moving near you. Your efforts are rewarded, as you hear a quiet creak from the floorboards behind you. Your reaction is lightning fast as you pull the glass bottle from your pocket, whirl around, and swing it towards the head of the intruder with your full might. You feel the weight in your hand suddenly drop as the bottle explodes against the skull of the intruder, knocking them out cold and dousing them in vodka. You scream, a delayed reaction, and run back outside to your friends. They immediately call the cops and help you to drag the unconscious intruder to one of the empty closets. When the cops arrive, they find the person in the closet and arrest them, and you and your friends are mentioned in the local paper for contributing to the arrest of a suspected serial killer.</p>
