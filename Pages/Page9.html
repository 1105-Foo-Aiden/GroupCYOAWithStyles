      You and your friends decide to head back to the house. As you all are in
      eyesight of the cabin, you hear footsteps behind you as something from the
      woods pursues. You and your friends realize what is happening and start
      sprinting towards the cabin, the thing behind you starts yelling and
      screaming, kicking you into high gear, running faster towards the cabin.
      Your friends are close behind, but one of them turns around yelling "Keep
      going I'll hold them off!". Instantly, the thing tackles your friend to
      the ground, roaring as he does.

    <p>Your friend is powerless against the creature and is torn to shreds.
    </p>
    <p>
      You hear his cries as you all keep running. Getting to the cabin, you and
      your friends close all the doors and windows to barricade yourselves
      inside. You all mourne the loss of your friend and try to process what
      just happene, saying how brave he was to distract the monster and others
      saying how stupid he was to do that. After a while, the creature began
      banging on the doors and peering through the windows. You all rush to the
      basement, making sure you don't make noise and alert the creautre. You all
      sit in a circle and stay close until the morning, no one daring to close
      their eyes for more than a minute. In the morning, the banging and the
      roaring stopped and you all carefully left the basement. You go and see
      the friend that stayed behind but his body was gone and there was no trace
      of what that thing did to him. You all head back to your cars, hoping that
      whatever that creature was was gone.
