    <p>You choose to let the fire fizzle out so you and your friends can head back to the cabin. As you all blearily make your way back up to the cabin, you notice that everyone is sticking pretty close together. The campfire stories, while completely fictional and definitely exaggerated, seem almost plausible in the eerie silence of the night. Everyone seemed to have the scary stories on their mind, because nobody strayed from the huddled group you guys had formed until you all reached the front door of the cabin. As you all entered the somewhat warmer and dimly lit cabin though, the tension in the air seemed to lift for a moment. Before you could fully enjoy the warmth and safety of the cabin, you wanted to get the fireplace going. Even in autumn, the nights on the mountain could be frigid and unforgiving if you were unprepared. As you separated from your friends to grab the firewood your family kept stored near the back door, the temporary sense of ease you had felt earlier shatters. The back door of the cabin, which had been locked and untouched since your family was up here last, was ever-so-slightly ajar with the padlock missing. You feel a chill up your spine- this time from fear rather than the temperature, and quickly sprint back down the hall.</p>
    <p>As you run back to your friends, what will you do?</p>
