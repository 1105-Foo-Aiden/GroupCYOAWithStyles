      You decide that the coldness in the cabin was the result of an open window
      and that you shouldn't worry about it and turn to leave. As you grab the
      door handle, someone grabs you from behind and holds a knife to your
      throat,<br />"Don't say a single word."<br />
      The man whispered into your ear.<br />"Just give yourself up and I will
      spare all of your friends out there. They won't know a thing."<br />
      You don't want to see your friends get hurt so you nod your head slowly
      and then everything goes dark... <br /><br />
      You wake up to the smell of burning wood and blood. The man stands over
      you with what looks like red facepaint. He laughed as he tied your hands
      and feet to a stake and stick it into the ground. The man begins to dance
      around in a circle and chant something that sounds like latin but you
      can't make out as he circles you. After a while, the man began to bow
      repeatedly continuing the chant. All of a sudden, a loud roar erupts from
      the forest, and the ground below you begins to crack and seperate, opening
      the ground beneath you to reveal a firey red pit. The pit was in fact a
      protal to hell, and the demons were begining to fly out from the pit and
      around you. The demons start tearing your flesh, bringing it back to the
      pit. Eventually they grab your whole body, and throw you down the pit
      right into hell as the hole closes up behind you.
