    <p>
        You decide that the coldness in the cabin was the result of an open window and that you shouldn't worry about it and turn to leave.
        As you grab the door handle, someone grabs you from behind and holds a knife to your throat,<br>"Don't say a single word."<br>
        The man whispered into your ear.<br>"Just give yourself up and I will spare all of your friends out there. They won't hear a thing."<br>
        You don't want to see your friends get hurt so you nod your head slowly and then everything goes dark. <br><br>
        You wake up to the smell of burning wood and blood. The man stands over you with red facepaint.
