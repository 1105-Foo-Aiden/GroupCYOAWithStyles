    <p>As you and your group of friends exit the two cars you drove up here, you stop to take a deep breath of the fresh mountain air. The drive was long, and your friend kept putting on Taylor Swift during the three hour drive, but all is right with the world now that you have arrived safely at the vacation cabin. It's a weathered old cabin that your family owned and used as a vacation retreat during winter, but this time you were here with your friends in the middle of autumn. In fact, it was Halloween today. According to the local legend you were told every year as a kid, there was a killer that stalked the mountains, and every Halloween night would find people to sacrifice to the demon that keeps them alive. As you helped your friends bring in their bags and find their rooms you feel the frigid mountian air pick up, causing you to draw your coat tighter around you. It was significantly colder up here compared to the city, but that just meant it was the perfect climate to set up a small campfire tonight. The freedom of it all was so exciting, it felt like nothing could go wrong this weekend.</p>
    <p>With help, you are able to get a campfire going as the sun starts to dip below the trees. You enjoy the warmth of the fire for a few minutes as everyone trickles out of the cabin and join you by the fire. Everyone is here, but before you sit down you recall there may be snacks and drinks to share inside the cabin. What do you do?</p>
