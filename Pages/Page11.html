    <p>As you almost barrel into your friends, you tell them to find weapons to protect themselves; something, or someone, is in the cabin. You leave half the group to grab what they can from the kitchen, while you led the other half to one of the storage closets where your family kept sports equipment and outdoor work tools. As you fling the closet door open and start handing out baseball bats and shovels, your eyes go straight to the empty axe holder. You barely have time to whirl around and tell your friends before you hear a blood-curdling scream come from the kitchen.</p>
    <p>As you run into the kitchen, you brandish the pickaxe you grabbed last-minute from the closet. You see an unfamiliar form wearing a ghoulishly white mask and feel ice in your heart, but you do not stop. Not even when you see one of your friends on the ground or blood on the tile. The momentumn of your pickaxe does not falter for a moment as you plunge the tip directly into the chest of the stranger. Your aim is true and the intruder is struck by your weapon, causing them to stop attacking your friends. The rest of your group, seeing an opportunity, all take turns attacking and trying to drive the intruder out of the house with their makeshift weapons. Despite recieving blow after blow, the dangerous stranger refuses to retreat, and after a whirlwind of desperate attacks, finally falls to the ground, silent and unmoving. It hardly feels like any time has passed when the cops arrive- you've barely been able to process everything that just happened. In the end you were able to permanently stop this killer that had been terrorizing the area for decades, but it cost a couple of your friends their lives. You and all of your friends are remembered as heroes.</p>
